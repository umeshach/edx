Foundations of Data Analysis Course
===

# Course Description
This course is intended to have the same “punch” as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling.  This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics.  Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R).
